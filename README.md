üëã Hi there! I'm Kyle Pollard. I'm in beautiful British Columbia, Canada üçÅ [(UTC-8)](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/canada/vancouver)

I am a [full-stack developer on the Public Platform team at Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/3023052/kylejrp) working with .NET and JavaScript. I graduated university with a double major in Computer Science and Mathematics. Previously, I was working at my local municipality as a full-stack enterprise .NET web developer doing project management, application development, and application maintenance. I'm also a proud husband and [father](https://twitter.com/kylejrp/status/1279159657722810368?s=20). üòä

In my personal projects, I work with vanilla HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I love building static sites on the [Jamstack](https://jamstack.org/). I help maintain [Water.css](https://github.com/kognise/water.css), a simple classless stylesheet for smaller scope sites.

Outside of programming, I play the saxophone, I 3D model and print on a [Prusa MK3](https://www.prusa3d.com/original-prusa-i3-mk3/), I play VR games on an [HTC Vive](https://www.vive.com/ca/), and I am the Dungeon Master in a Dungeons & Dragons campaign. I also enjoy watching [explanations of old video game architecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZI50XUeN6QE), [reverse engineering glitches](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8OBktd42GI), and [security issues for bug bounties](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-P9USG6kLs).

I use [Fira Code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode) at a [really high font size](https://medium.com/@mykola_harmash/developer-tip-to-save-your-eyes-f83135baa64c) and use [f.lux](https://justgetflux.com/) to save my eyes. 

Feel free reach out by messaging me publicly or privately on my [Twitter](https://twitter.com/kylejrp)!
